## Lessons Learned and Recommendation
Through data analysis, it was found that best-selling products like Burgers, Fries, and Beverages drive significant revenue, suggesting a focus on product-specific promotions. Payment methods also impact revenue, with different patterns observed for cash, credit cards, and gift cards, guiding tailored payment strategies.

Performance varies by manager and country, indicating the importance of region-specific strategies to enhance efficiency. Box and whisker plots revealed insights into price distribution, helping to refine pricing by identifying optimal price ranges and outliers.

Recommendation: 
  1. Focus on Top Products: Prioritize marketing and upsell strategies for best-selling items like Burgers and Beverages, which contribute most to revenue. Customization of promotions can further boost these product categories.

  2. Optimize Payment Systems: Tailor payment strategies to maximize revenue, encouraging the use of high-revenue payment methods (e.g., credit cards) through loyalty programs or incentives for gift card usage.

  3. Manager and Regional Performance: Implement regular performance assessments across managers and regions to address underperformance. Introduce regional-specific strategies that account for local preferences and market conditions.

  4. Refine Pricing Strategies: Use descriptive statistics and data visualizations to continuously evaluate product pricing. Adjust prices to stay competitive while maintaining profit margins, focusing on outliers and price sensitivity.

  5. Continue Data-Driven Decision Making: Leverage pivot tables and visualization tools to further analyze trends, identifying new opportunities for product improvement, cost management, and revenue growth.

## Limitation and What Can Be Improved

Limitations
- The analysis was limited by Excel’s capacity for handling large datasets and lacked insights into individual customer behavior or external factors like seasonality and market trends.

Improvements
- Future analysis could benefit from using tools like Power BI or Tableau for more detailed insights. Incorporating customer segmentation and external data (e.g., competitor pricing) would improve decision-making.
